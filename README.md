## Setting up for development

### Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have accounts and API keys for the following services:
- [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com) for speech-to-text.
- [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) for text-to-speech.
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) for GPT responses.

### 1. Configure backend environment variables
In the `backend/` directory, create a `.env` file and configure the following environment variables:

```bash
SERVER="yourserverdomain.com"
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-XXXXXX"
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY="YOUR-DEEPGRAM-API-KEY"
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY="YOUR-ELEVENLABS-API-KEY"
FROM_NUMBER='+12223334444'
TO_NUMBER='+13334445555'
```

### 2. Install backend dependencies
Navigate to the `backend/` directory and install the necessary packages:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 3. Install frontend dependencies
Navigate to the `frontend/ directory and install the necessary packages:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 4. Configure frontend environment variables
In the frontend/ directory, create a .env file and configure the following login environment variables:

```bash
REACT_APP_USERNAME=********
REACT_APP_PASSWORD=********
```

### 5. Start the backend server in development mode
In the `backend/` directory, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 6. Start the frontend application
In the frontend/ directory, run:

```bash
npm start
```

### 7. Access the application
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`to access the frontend application.

### How AriaCall works
AriaCall orchestrates interactions between multiple services (Deepgram, OpenAI, ElevenLabs) to handle voice calls in real time:

1. **Deepgram** transcribes the audio and returns text in real time.
2. **OpenAI** GPT processes the text and generates responses.
3. **ElevenLabs** converts GPT’s text into speech, which is sent back and played to the caller.

...and everything should start up for you! 🚀
