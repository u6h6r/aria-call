## How AriaCall Works
AriaCall orchestrates interactions between multiple services (Deepgram, OpenAI) to handle voice calls in real time. 

1. **Deepgram** transcribes the audio and returns text in real time.
2. **OpenAI GPT** processes the text and generates responses.
3. **Deepgram** converts GPT‚Äôs text into speech, which is sent back and played to the caller.
