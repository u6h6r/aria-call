## Setting up for Development

### Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have accounts and API keys for the following services:
- [Twilio](https://twilio.com) for media streaming and telephony services.
- [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com) for speech-to-text and text-to-speech.
- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com) for GPT responses.

### 1. Start Ngrok
You‚Äôll need a tunnel to expose your local server to Twilio. Run the following command:

```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

Ngrok will give you a unique URL, like `abc123.ngrok.io`. Copy the URL without http:// or https://. You'll need this URL in the next step.

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create`.env` and configure the following environment variables:

```bash
SERVER="yourserverdomain.com"
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-XXXXXX"
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY="YOUR-DEEPGRAM-API-KEY"
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID="YOUR-ACCOUNT-SID"
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN="YOUR-AUTH-TOKEN"
FROM_NUMBER='+12223334444'
TO_NUMBER='+13334445555'
```

### 3. Install Dependencies with NPM
Install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start Your Server in Development Mode
Run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Run app locally

Simply by double click on index.html to launch app frontend in your local browser.

This setup routes incoming call audio to AriaCall.

## How AriaCall Works
AriaCall orchestrates interactions between multiple services (Twilio, Deepgram, OpenAI) to handle voice calls in real time. 

1. **Twilio media streams** sends incoming audio to your WebSocket server.
2. **Deepgram** transcribes the audio and returns text in real time.
3. **OpenAI GPT** processes the text and generates responses.
4. **Deepgram** converts GPT‚Äôs text into speech, which is sent back to Twilio and played to the caller.
